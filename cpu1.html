		<h2>CPU - Processor</h2>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Here is a little shorter text of the CPU for those of you who are planning to either buy a CPU or just want to learn more about it softly. We can begin by taking up the clock speed, what is clock speed? The clock speed is the speed in your CPU, how fast the CPU is, and it is measured in hertz. A processor with 1,0 GHz is capable of doing one billion clock cycles per second. Now if you look on different CPUs you will often see clock speeds between 3,0 to 4,0 GHz. Something that is very important is to not get fooled by the clock speed. Just because a CPU has high speed it does not mean that it is better than another CPU with 0,3 less GHz in speed. For example look at the amount of cores the CPU has, look at the amount of threads it has. The number of cores is important since it is the cores that make the calculations. The more cores, the more calculations which is a good thing, so if you could combine good speed with cores that is a great thing. Different processors are simply good at different things. However, make sure to buy a processor capable of the things you do on computer, for example if you are playing games make sure to have a powerful CPU.<br>

		<h3>Geek facts</h3>
		<p>CPU, also called processor is one of the computers main components, it is actually one of the most important main components. CPU that is standing for Central Processing Unit is the component that acts as a brain, it makes a lot of calculations. It makes calculations just like any other component, but the CPU makes the majority of all calculations, therefore it is the main component. It does not matter if the instructions the processor gets is large or small, it all goes through the processor. This brain does not really work like a human brain, all humans have kind of the same brains but the processors is available in various types that is good in different ways. </p>
		<h3>X86, X64</h3>

		<p>X86, X86-64, X64
		The most common processor in our PCs and laptops that we use today is called X86. It is because the processor type is made for Mac OS X and Windows. The name comes from an older generation of processors from Intel, whose processors called 286, 386 and 486. I guess they took the X86 because they all ended with 86 and then put an X in front of it. It is similar to the nvidia GTX series with graphics cards that are called 680, 780, 880 (For laptops) and 980 and so on. So in the future nvidia might use the name x80 for something, maybe a cooler named x80 for the 2080 series, might sound dumb but that is not impossible. One of the biggest development steps for the X86 was when they switched from 32-bit-based to 64-bit-based, the biggest advance in this change was that you could still run the old 32-bit applications, and the 64-bit applications as well. While this change happened they renamed X86 to X86-64 because it was 64-bits, sometimes people called it X64 which caused certain confusion. </p>
		<h3>ARM-processors</h3>
		<img id="arm" src="img/arm.png" alt="Picture on ARM logo"/>
		<p>ARM, v7-v8 Another type of CPU is the one called ARM. It is usually used for mobile phones and tablets. ARM stands for Advanced RISC Machine, and this processor uses less power and gives better battery life. The different operating systems for the phone that are iOS, Windows Phone and Android, these are 3 operating systems that is made for the ARM CPU. Sometimes android uses the X86 CPU but it is most common with the ARM processors in the tablets or phones. ARM is also available in both 32- and 64-bit-based versions. The 32-bit-based version is called ARM v7 and the 64-bit-based version is called ARM v8. If someone would like to compare the two different types, ARM and X86 there are some important things to point out. X86 is a processor with high performance but at the same time it takes a lot of more power, but the ARM is less power taking but gives a much more poor performance. Which is why ARM is in phones and X86 for computers. It is however more common for the X86 processors to be more power efficient so that they can be used in phones, that is why Android has decided to try it. At the same time it is more common for the ARM processors to deliver more performance. The conclusion is that X86 is a CPU with high performance and that needs more power and the ARM is very power efficient but gives less performance.</p>
		<h3>Hertz - The pulse of the processor</h3>
		<p>Speed or frequency as you call it is measured in hertz (Hz). It shows how many clock cycles per second a processor has time for. If a processor has 1,0 GHz in frequency it means it has time for one billion clock cycles per second. Or if a processor is 3,5 GHz as clock frequency it has time for three and a half billion clock cycles per second. In the beginning when you measured the speed you measured it in MHz, but since it came over 1000 MHz we began to count it in GHz, today a processor can be overclocked to over 5,0 GHz but in some cases more. When you have a clock frequency that high it takes a lot of power and gets very hot, that is why the new products today needs good cooling. If you overclock a processor too much, it will most likely melt since it cannot handle the high temperatures. Because of this we were forced to find a new way to make processor better without the higher clock frequency. Then they got the idea to make the processor more efficient in the way that it could do more in one clock cycle. So in the current situation the clock frequency does not tell us everything about the processor, a processor with 3,2 GHz can be much more powerful than a processor with 3,5 GHz. They say that you can only compare the clock frequency if both processors are from the same generation and model.
