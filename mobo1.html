	<h2>MOBO - Motherboard</h2>
		<img src="img/mobo.png" alt="Picture on a MOBO"/>
       <h3>Introduction</h3>
       <p>Today we are going to take a look at the nervous system of the computer, this is the motherboard. As you can see it is one of the bigger components. The reason it is so big is because this is the component that connects everything together, so you need space for every component or at least a cable for every component. You can also say MOBO, mainboard, system board or logic board. There are a lot of names for this component. There are also a lot of different sizes of motherboards, the most usual one is ATX. This is an ATX motherboard. The other two most usual sizes is Mini-ATX and Mikro-ATX. ATX motherboards is popular in the gaming world since they can handle better stuff and gives better opportunities for better performance. Basic Input / Output System or BIOS as we say has the most important and simplest functions. It allows you to start the computer with your keyboard, mouse and hard drives and so on. The BIOS starts the devices first then it starts the operating system that you have installed. </p>
        <h3>Geek facts</h3>
		<p>Mainboard, motherboard or MOBO, there are many different names on this component. This is the component that puts it all together, it connects all components in one way or another. Everything goes through the motherboard since the graphics card, processor and all the other components are connected to the motherboard. Here are the things that are on a motherboard.</p>

   <h3>External Connections</h3>

   <h3>The different sizes</h3>
<p>A lot has happened in ten years, especially in the art. There is a very big difference in motherboards ten years ago and now. In the past, it was not obvious that there were USB ports, network ports, etc. Sometimes you could find the graphics card built in to the motherboard, which is not the particularly good and would probably be used for office computers. There are also built in graphics cards into processors.
There are also a lot of different sizes of motherboards, Mini-ITX, mATX and ATX.</p>

<p> MikroATX and ATX are the two most common varieties of motherboards. ATX is the most common but mATX has sold more and more in present times and because it is quite compact and nowadays it can handle more. ATX is more popular in the gaming world because it is a type that can handle worse stuff. It has more advanced technology for gaming and provides good performance with good features, MSi provides CPU overclocking feautures for example. The different sizes fits in different chassis sizes, mATX is fitting well in small chassis and that can be good for an office computer that has to be small, or if you are going to a LAN it would be nice with a smaller computer. There are also less chassis that only holds mATX, because then the bigger model ATX cannot fit into the chassis. MATX motherboards is like I said earlier popular in the office sector, because the computer gets smaller, less weight and still does it job. However mATX motherboards fit into chassis with the normal ATX size. Another small type of motherboard is mini-ITX. It is a popular type in the office sector also. Mini-ITX sometimes has a pre-assembled Intel Atom processor that have incredibly low heat which leads to it does not need a fan. As long as the air and the ventilation around the processor is good it does not need one, which makes the computer smaller since it does not need a fan around the processor. So mini-ITX computers can be very small, mATX can be pretty small and still give some good performance and ATX is the way to go for hardcore gamers.</p>
<h3>BIOS</h3>
<p>Basic Input / Output System or BIOS as we say has the most important and the simplest functions. All hardware in your computer works with the BIOS. BIOS gets instructions from a small chip located on the motherboard, it makes the devices in the computer start, for example the mouse, keyboard or hard drives etc. Once it is started, you can run an operating system, for example Windows 7, 8 or 10 or whatever OS you like. BIOS is thus the most basic software installed in the computer. If you try to install a new operation system on an outdated BIOS you may find some problems such as crashes and instability, but it is easily remedied by updating the BIOS on the motherboard to a newer version so you can run a new OS.</p>
