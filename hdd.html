	<h2>HDD/SSD - Hard drive</h2>
		<img src="img/hdd2.png" alt="Picture on a HDD"/>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Today we are going to take a look at the long time memory in your computer,
			 this is the hard drive and a solid state drive. The work that these two
			  components have is to store data, for example your pictures, music,
			   documents, movies and games. The standard mechanical disk
			    stores data by using discs and magnetism. The SSD uses a new technology,
				 it uses something called a flash chip, and we use these chips in RAM
				  memories and USB memories as well. This makes the SSD a lot of
				   faster, but it also makes it very expensive. The price of SSD
				    units is much higher per gigabyte than on HDD units. So I
					 recommend you to combine these two when you buy a computer,
					  why? Because you can install your operating system along with
					   the games on the SSD so the computer gets much faster and you
					    can install all documents, music, movies and pictures on the
						 HDD because you don’t need these to be very fast. The SSD
						  unit can read and write data up to 500 MB per second and
						   the HDD unit can read and write data up to 80 MB per second,
						    now you see how many times faster they are. The most common
							 physical sizes of the hard drives is 3,5 inches and 2,5 inches.
							  The SSD usually has the physical size of 2,5 inches as well.</p>
		<h3>Geek facts</h3>
		<p>There are many different ways to store data. The two most common types
			 of hard drives is the usual mechanical hard drive and the solid state
			  drive, also known as the SSD. A standard hard drive stores data by
			   using discs and magnetism. The SSD is using a new technology, the
			    technology allows us to store the data up to two times faster than
				 on a mechanical disk. The SSD unit does not use the discs or magnetism
				  it uses flash chips, it is used in RAM-memories and it allows is
				   to get the information incredibly quickly. This makes an SSD
				    incredibly good and fast, the problem arrives when you look at
					 the price. The price of SSD units is much higher per gigabyte
					  than on HDDs. The best thing you could to is to combine a HDD
					   with a SSD if you’re buying a computer. For example, install
					    the operating system on the SSD-unit and some games that you
						 play and then the other things like programs, music, movies,
						  pictures and documents on the HDD unit. If you are investing
						   a good amount of money then I recommend you to buy a SSD unit
						    for only the operating system and one for only the games that
							 you play, if you want more memory to store other documents
							  then you can have a hard drive as a reserve.</p>
							  <h3>HDD/SSD who win?</h3>
							  <img id="mw22" src="img/hddsdd1.jpg" alt="Picture on two disks"/>
		<p>The speed of a SSD unit is a lot faster than on a mechanical disk
			 so just for an example, it is common that a SSD can read or write
			  data up to 500 MB/s or more, meanwhile a regular mechanical HDD
			   can only read and write data up to 80 MB/s. If you have the operating
			    system on a SSD unit you will get to de desktop twice as fast when you
				 start the computer if you compare with a HDD unit.</p>	
				 <h3>Sizes</h3>
				 <img id="mw2" src="img/ssdhdd.jpg" alt="Picture on two disks"/>
		<p>The two most common physical sizes of the hard drives are 3.5’’ and
			 2.5’’. 3.5’’ is the most the most usual size in desktop computers
			  and the 2.5’’ usually occurs in the laptops. A solid state drive
			   also has the size of 2.5’’. The advantage of the large disks is
			    that they can have much more memory than a disk with the size
				 of 2.5’’ if it is a mechanical disk. A 3.5’’ mechanical disk
				  can store up to 8 TB and a smaller 2.5’’ can only hold up to 2 TB.</p>
				  <h3>Performance and speed</h3>
		<p>The performance can be seen in different ways, for example speed. The
			 speed is measured in RPM(Revolutions per minute) just like the fans
			  on your graphics card or if you have extra fans in your computer box.
			   The rpm system shows how much it spins per minute. Most 3.5’’ spins
			    around between 5400-7200 RPM while the smaller 2.5’’ usually spins with
				 the speed of 5400 RPM. Just like in a processor the speed does not tell
				  us everything about how good the component is. If the hard drive has better
				   print heads and a more clever reading it increases the performance even
				    more. Cache memory is something that the hard drives also has. Cache
					 is a feature that allows the data that has been recently used to be
					  stored in a cache memory sections. It allows us to obtain access to
					   the data faster than the hard drive is really capable of. There
					    have been many different ways to connect a hard drive to the
						 motherboard. Today we use something that is called SATA. It
						  stand for Serial ATA and it is usually used in all modern
						   computers since it replaced the predecessor EIDE completely.
						    The reason they changed the EIDEs is because SATA is much better
							 in many ways. For example, the connectors and cables are much
							  smaller, much smaller. The cable is easier to pull inside the
							   chassis since it is smaller. It provides a sleeker and more
							    stylish chassis that provides better ventilation which is
								 important, at least the ventilation. SATA is capable of
								  higher transmission and that allows the computer to run
								   faster since it can transfer data faster. You only use
								    one cable per unit, so one cable for the optical units
									 and the hard drives and so on. </p>
									 <h3>Sata cables</h3>
	    <p>There are different types of SATA cables with different speeds, SATA 1.5 GB/s,
			 SATA 3 GB/s and SATA 6 GB/s. These cables are only different because of their
			  speed. There are also other types of SATA cables. For example, the Slim-SATA
			   that you often use to the DVD player inside of a small laptop. It is used in
			    the laptops because the cable is slim as you can hear in the name. Another
				 cable is the Micro-SATA cable, it is usually used for 1.8’’ units, this is
				  a cable that consists with power connection and data connection</p>
				  <h3>External hard drive</h3>
				  <img id="EDD" src="img/externalhdd.jpg" alt="Picture on EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE"/>
		<p>There are also something that we call external hard drives. A hard drive that is
			 external is a hard drive that is outside of your computer and that can be plugged
			  in to your USB port for example. When you plug it in it is like a regular internal
			   hard drive. There are various cables to connect an external hard drive but the
			    USB 3.0 port is the fastest since it can almost transfer up to 10.000 MB/s.</p>
