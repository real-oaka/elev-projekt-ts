	<h2>RAM - Random access memory</h2>
		<img src="img/ram1.png" alt="Picture on RAM"/>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Today we are going to take a look at the short time memory in your computer,
			 this is the RAM. There are some different names for this component as well
			  RAM, random access memory or working memory. You can say whatever you want
			   and what you think sounds best. The task that the RAM has is the same as
			    the other components with memories, store bits. The difference is that
				 all of them store it in different ways. The RAM stores the data that
				  the processor needs quickly. If you look at the hard drive it store
				   a lot of data, the data is your files and so on. The RAM stores data
				    from your running programs and gives the information to the processor.
					 An example of how they work together is when you start your computer
					  with an operating system, the RAM takes data from the hard drive and
					   then sends it to the processor that works together with the RAM and
					    that is how your operating system starts. If you have a solid state
						 drive disk that is much faster than a regular mechanical disk the
						  RAM will get access to the operating system much faster and that
						   is why your computer starts faster if you have windows on one
						    of these disks. There are also various types of RAM memories
							 one of them is called Dimm, and this is a Dimm memory, it is
							  usually used in standard desktop computers. </p>
		<h3>Geek facts - What is RAM?</h3>
		<p>RAM is one of the most important and basic part of your computer. There are many different
			 types and models that have different technologies, sizes and clock frequencies. There are
			  more than one name to this component as well, you can say internal memory, main memory,
			   random access memory or working memory. All of these words stands for RAM in one way
			    or another. The task that the RAM is the same task as the other components with
				 memories has. For example, hard drives, flash memory, cache memories and so on.
				  All of these store data that is written in bit, so it stores a lot of ones and
				   zeros. The difference is that all of the devices store them in different ways.
				    The RAM stores the data that the processor need quickly, if you compare it with
					 a hard drive then the hard drive store a lot of data. The data that the hard
					  drive store is not the data the processor needs quickly because the hard drive
					   is to slow for the processor, that is why RAM exist because it is much faster.</p>
		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		<p>When you start a computer with an operating system the RAM takes data from the hard
			 drive and then sends it to the processor that works together with the RAM. This is
			  how it all work, it is the same if you start another application, for example a game.
			   This is the reason why it is good to have a lot of RAM so that it can store as much
			    information as possible. Compare it with your hard drive, I am sure that you want
				 enough space to store all movies, pictures, music and games. It is the same with
				  the RAM but the only thing that is stored in the RAM is the programs you have up
				   and running. If your computer gets slower with the years it is usually because
				    your computer has lots of unnecessary programs running in the background that
					 takes up memory from your RAM. When you start your computer it might take a
					  long time, sometimes it is because you have lots of programs that is starting
					   together with your operating system. The best thing is to turn it off so they
					    do not start automatically. You can change which programs you want to start
						 and what programs you do not want to start but make sure you do not turn
						  of anything that has to be started together with the operating system.
						   It might cause problems and in some cases the computer might not even
						    start anymore. </p>
		<h3>Virtual memory</h3>
		<img id="vmemory" src="img/virtualmemory.jpg" alt="Picture on a message saying that the Virtual Memory is running low"/>
		<p>Virtual memory is something that the computer use when your RAM is not quite enough.
			 The computer uses a portion of the hard drive to store the programs on while running.
			  This happens if your RAM is full or if there is data that does not need to be accessed
			   as quickly as the data stored in the RAM. It is the quick solution the computer use
			    and if you get a popup box that says that the virtual memory also is full it might
				 be a sign to go buy yourself some new RAMs. A lot of RAM is recommended, but make
				  sure you do not get too much for the operating system or if any other components
				   cannot handle much RAM. If you have a 32-bit operating system you cannot have more
				    than 4GB memory because it is not able to worth with more bits. You can always
					 upgrade the operating system at the same time you are upgrading your RAM.</p>
		<h3>Dimm and So-Dimm</h3>
		<img id="dimm" src="img/dimm1.jpg" alt="Picture on Dimm RAM"/>
		<img id="sodimm" src="img/sodimm.jpg" alt="Picture on SO-dimm RAM"/>
		<p>There are also different types of RAMs. Dimm and So-dimm. You can find them in almost
			 any desktop or laptop computer on the market. Something that can be fun to know is that
			  if you have a MacBook Air for example, you cannot replace the RAM memories because they
			   are soldered onto the motherboard. The product is probably good enough so you do not
			    have to replace it but it is good to know, especially if you are reading this and is
				 thinking about changing it. Back to Dimm and So-dimm. Dimm(Dual In-Line Memory Module)
				  is the model after Simm(Single In-Line Memory Module), the reason that Simm did not
				   get very successful is because the bus width was not large enough. The reason why
				    it was not large enough is because the modern processors needed data faster and
					 Simm only had 32-bit. Dimm on the other side had 64-bit instead. So-dimm are
					  not from another generation or something like that. It is just another model
					   that is smaller that is used in laptops or in other small computers.
					    There are different type of Dimm memories and they are known as DDR, DDR2,
						 DDR3 and DDR4. DDR4 is the latest, fastest and is often used in todays
						  performance computers.</p>
		<h3>Treat it with love</h3>
		<p>It is very important that you manage a RAM with love and respect so you do not destroy
			 the memory modules. To give it a static discharge can destroy the entire RAM. It may
			  come with an insidious effect or you will notice it right away. It might crash, get
			   blue screen or other things that will annoy you.</p>
